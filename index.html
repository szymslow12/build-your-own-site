        <p class="intro">I am 21 years old. I live in small village near Tarn√≥w. From November 2017,
            I attend a computer programming course in Codecool. I enjoy it very much.<br>
            This website is my next exercise in course. It's not my first contact with HTML:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>I created first html in school</li>
                <li>Second for my friend, he needed it to pass IT lessons</li>
                <li>Third one is that website</li>
            </ul>
            It's not much but better than nothing ;)<br> In this exercise i learned new things related with HTML:
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>CSS</strong>- used for formatting all content on this site</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong>- makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
                    I used it in contact page.</li>
            </ul>
        In addition to programing, I also like MMORPG games and anime.
        This website is about my best MMORPG game and best anime.
