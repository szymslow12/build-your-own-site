                <p>I am 21 years old. I live in small village near Tarn√≥w. From November 2017,
                    I attend a computer programming course in Codecool. I enjoy it very much.<br>
                    This website is my next exercise in course. It's not my first contact with HTML:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I created first html in school</li>
                        <li>Second for my friend, he needed it to pass IT lessons</li>
                        <li>Third one is that website</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>It's not much but better than nothing ;)<br> In this exercise i learned new things related
                    with HTML:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CSS</strong>- used for formatting all content on this site</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong>- makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
                            I used it in contact page.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>In addition to programing, I also like MMORPG games and anime.</p>

            <p1> Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are a combination 
                of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which a very
                large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world.
                <br>
                As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy
                world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. 
                MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number
                of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted 
                by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game.    
                <br>
                MMORPGs are played throughout the world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005, 
                and Western revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006. In 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by 
                consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion. World of Warcraft, a popular MMORPG, has over 
                10 million subscribers as of November 2014. World of Warcraft's total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars 
                in 2014. Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011, became the world's 'Fastest-Growing MMOG Ever' 
                after gaining more than 1 million subscribers within the first three days of its launch</p1>
