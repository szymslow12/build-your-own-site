            <p><strong>Star Wars The Old Republic (SWTOR)</strong>is a massively multiplayer online 
                role-playing game (MMORPG) based in the Star Wars universe. Developed by BioWare
                Austin and a supplemental team at BioWare Edmonton, the game was announced on October 
                21, 2008. The video game was released for the Microsoft Windows platform on December
                20, 2011 in North America and part of Europe. Early access to the game began one week 
                before release, on December 13, 2011, for those who had pre-ordered the game online;
                access opened in "waves" based on pre-order date. <br>This story takes place in the 
                Star Wars fictional universe shortly after the establishment of a tenuous peace between
                the re-emergent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The game features eight different 
                <span class="hover-item-list">classes</span>. Each of the eight classes has a three act storyline that progresses as the 
                character levels up. Players join either the Republic or the Sith, but players may 
                possess a morality at any point along the light/dark spectrum. Different classes favor 
                different styles of gameplay, and the game features extensive customization options, 
                fully voiced dialogue, companion characters, and dialogue options similar to BioWare's own Mass Effect series. </p>
