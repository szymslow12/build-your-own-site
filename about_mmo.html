            <p><strong> Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)</strong> are a combination 
                of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which a very
                large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world.
                <br>
                As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy
                world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. 
                MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number
                of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted 
                by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game.    
                <br>
                MMORPGs are played throughout the world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005, 
                and Western revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006. In 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by 
                consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion. World of Warcraft, a popular MMORPG, has over 
                10 million subscribers as of November 2014. World of Warcraft's total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars 
                in 2014. Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011, became the world's 'Fastest-Growing MMOG Ever' 
                after gaining more than 1 million subscribers within the first three days of its launch<br>Read more about:</p>
